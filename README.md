Visualizing and analyzing geospatial and temporal observations are common tasks for many application domains. In this paper, we introduce UFO_tracker, a visual analytics tool for analyzing unidentified flying object sightings from the National UFO Reporting Center. The goal here is to give the user a higher level view of where different types of sightings occur, to investigate whether sightings are increasing or decreasing over time, and to discover the connections between different events which might happen at different geographic areas. Multiple visualization and data mining techniques are combined to make sense the increasingly large UFO reports which get updated hourly. 
Our initial application targets UFO sighting reports. However, we believe our approach has wider applications in other research domains, such as analyzing text corpus obtained from social media.
