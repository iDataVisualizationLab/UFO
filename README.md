# UFO
Unidentified Flying Objects, or UFOs, are commonly described as anything that can be seen in the sky but can not be identified as known object. The story of UFOs began in 1947 in the US  when the fast moving, glistening objects were observed from the sky. Inspired by this phenomenon, National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), founded by Robert J. Gribble, has been recording this phenomenon (called UFOs sightings) since 1974 bases on user reports. Until now, there are over 100,000 UFOs sightings have been recorded.
Despite over 70 years of observations and 40 years of data collections, the reported evidences are still uncorroborated. Therefore, the rumors of UFO sightings are still interesting over the years: the UFO really exists?
